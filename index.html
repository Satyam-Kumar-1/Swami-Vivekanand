      He was an Indian Hindu monk.He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, and is credited with raising interfaith awareness,bringing <br>Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.
    </li>
    <li>
        He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the words <strong>"Sisters and brothers of America ...</strong>, in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in <strong> 1893</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>  Vivekananda </strong> was born on 12th January 1863 in  into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta.Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images <br>of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Narendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading.In <strong> 1871</strong>, at the age of eight, he enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution.he was the only student <br> to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination.He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature.<br>
       <li> He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. <!-- Narendra was trained in Indian classical music,and<br> regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known <br> as the Scottish Church College).
        In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. -->
    </li> 
    </li>
    <li>
        In 1880 Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism.
        From <strong>1881 </strong>to<strong> 1884</strong>, <br>he was also active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.
        In 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884.
    </li>
    <li>
        One day, Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion,<br>he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess.Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything  <br>for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.
    </li>
    <li>
        In December<strong> 1886</strong>, the mother of Baburam invited Narendra and his other brother monks to Antpur village. Narendra and the other aspiring monks accepted the invitation and went to Antpur to spend few days.<br> In Antpur, in the Christmas Eve of 1886, Narendra and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows.They decided to live their lives as their master lived.Narendranath took the name <strong> "Swami Vivekananda"</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns.
        Vivekananda started his journey to the West <br> on <strong>31 May 1893 </strong>and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo),China and Canada en route to the United States,reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893,<br>where the <strong>"Parliament of Religions"</strong> took place in September <strong>1893</strong>.
       

        
    </li>
    <li>
        After the Parliament of Religions, he toured many parts of the US as a guest. His popularity opened up new views for expanding on "life and religion to thousands".<br>
        The ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on <strong>15 January 1897</strong>, <br>and Vivekananda received a warm welcome. In Colombo, he gave his first public speech in the East. From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant.

    </li>
    <li>
        Despite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899 accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England,<br> he went to the United States.

    </li>
    <li>
        On <strong>4 July 1902 </strong> (the day of his death),Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, <br>asking not to be disturbed;he died at 9:20 p.m.
        He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.
    </li>
    <li>
        Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation:
      <strong>  Each soul is potentially divine.<br> The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy—by one, or more, or all of these—and be free.<br>This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details</strong>.
 </li>
 <li>
    Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development.
 </li>
 <li>
    Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it.He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddhā (faith).
